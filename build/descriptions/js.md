# Javascript (ES6+)

Javascript is my language of choice. Even before ES6.

- es6
- SPA
- PWA
- node
- React

```javascript
let test = false;
```

That was some code, like: `const t = 5;`.

All of those things remain true, but in an ecosystem that moves extremely fast (NPM/Node) and creates epic amounts of vaporware and abandonware, we must constantly reevaluate all of our decisions and assumptions to make sure we are building a solid foundation for the future.
