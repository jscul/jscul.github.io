He always takes any chance he can get to ask for advice on the IT field, in a way it's allowed me to be in the front row seats when it comes to his career in IT. I've personally seen how John transformed from someone who was simply curious about IT, into a well rounded JavaScript expert, to the point where I often find myself asking him for advice now with anything JS from React to Node. But it doesn't stop there, I've been able to learn some nice DevOps tricks from John, Docker can be a hell of a beast.`,

His ability to solve complex problems and create elegant solutions in his code has piqued my interest in learning React myself! He's a very skilled developer that can tackle any challenge head on, bugs don't stand a chance!`,

  //   text: `The first time I worked with John, we pulled him onto a robotics project that I had been on for a year, with a team of iOS and Android developers. We were collaborating with a robotics team in California, building native mobile applications to seamlessly integrate with the robot's hardware and software. Our issue of having a robotic prototype, but no robotics developer on site, soon became a barrier to progress and efficiency. John, with support of his manager, jumped into the project with both feet. He learned quickly and was able to troubleshooting issues with the robot prototype, (both hardware and software), and keep the project moving ahead, in no time. This experience with John displayed his perseverance and curiosity, as well as his focus on the success of the overall team and project. Working with John since that project has been the same positive scenario of adaptability, determination and success.`,
