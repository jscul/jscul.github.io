He always takes any chance he can get to ask for advice on the IT field, in a way it's allowed me to be in the front row seats when it comes to his career in IT. I've personally seen how John transformed from someone who was simply curious about IT, into a well rounded JavaScript expert, to the point where I often find myself asking him for advice now with anything JS from React to Node. But it doesn't stop there, I've been able to learn some nice DevOps tricks from John, Docker can be a hell of a beast.`,

His ability to solve complex problems and create elegant solutions in his code has piqued my interest in learning React myself! He's a very skilled developer that can tackle any challenge head on, bugs don't stand a chance! `,
