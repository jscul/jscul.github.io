# http:// !== RESTful <sup>...but there wasn't a RESTful logo</sup>

I have experience with API work and stay up to date with newer technologies like <a target="_blank" class="graphql">GraphQL</a> and <a target="_blank" class="apollo">Apollo</a>.

For documentation, I've used both <a target="_blank" class="postman">Postman</a> and <a target="_blank" class="apollo" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/">Apollo's GraphQL Playground</a>.

Currently learning <a target="_blank" class="relay" href="https://relay.dev/">Relay</a>.
