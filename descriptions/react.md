It's what this site is made of - React w/ Redux is my go-to for any UI (including mobile applications with React Native).

- <a class="react" target="_blank">React v17</a> fluent (I've been an avid user since v14)
- Thorough understanding of the fundamentals: functional & class components, props, state lifecycle, hooks.
- <a class="redux" target="_blank">Redux</a> as global state accompanied with modular reusable components
- <a class="reactrouter" target="_blank">React Router</a> allows me to easily build SPAs (single-page applications).
- <a class="jsx" target="_blank">JSX</a> syntax

Anybody can build a static, non-interactive site. React is made for interactivity. I can do that.
